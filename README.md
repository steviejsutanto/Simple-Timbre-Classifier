# Simple-Timbre-Classifier
Node for Max with Tensorflow.js example

This is a simple example of timbre classifier in Max 8 using Tensorflow.js

You may need to install tensorflow module for Node.js under the same directory of the files. Look at https://js.tensorflow.org/#getting-started to get started

Node for Max is only available in Max 8. To see other examples, visit https://github.com/Cycling74/n4m-examples

The tensorflow.js code is partly inspired from Coding Train's Color Classifier example. Visit here for more information https://github.com/CodingTrain/ColorClassifer-TensorFlow.js
