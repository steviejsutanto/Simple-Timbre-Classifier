# Simple-Timbre-Classifier
Node for Max with Tensorflow.js example

This is a simple example of timbre classifier in Max 8 using Tensorflow.js

Please note that this classifier is only made for the purpose of n4m-tfjs-node demonstration. There are more advance timbre classifier libraries/modules with/without Machine Learning and Max out there such as https://github.com/wbrent/timbreID in PD.

You can install the required modules by clicking on [script npm install] inside the patcher file.

The simple_timbre_classifier.js code is partly inspired by Coding Train's Color Classifier example. Visit here for more information https://github.com/CodingTrain/ColorClassifer-TensorFlow.js.

Look at https://js.tensorflow.org/ for more info on the js code.

Node for Max is only available in Max 8. To see other examples, visit https://github.com/Cycling74/n4m-examples.
